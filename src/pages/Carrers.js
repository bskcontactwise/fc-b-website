            </ul>
            <h4>No No…</h4>
            <p>We’re not so keen on people who:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>
               play politics or waste effort on internal conflicts
               </li>
               <li>show prejudice of any kind</li>
               <li>use a command and control management style</li>
               <li>believe that closed doors are right and proper</li>
               <li>reach for the word ‘impossible’ at every opportunity.</li>
